Body Mass Index is your body mass divided by height squared, when measured in kilograms of weight and meters of height.

When weight is measured in pounds and height in inches, a conversion multiplier of 703 is required.  This web page does that conversion automatically. Enter or adjust your height and weight in the boxes to the left and your BMI will be displayed below your inputs.

#### Why do you care about your BMI?####
High body mass index values are associated with higher risk of diseases
including *diabetes and heart disease*. Low body mass index can also indicate
poor health and/or diet, or anorexia.

#### Is my BMI value okay?

If your calculated BMI is **less than 18.5**, you are **too skinny**; please see your doctor!

If your BMI is between 18.5 and 25, you appear to be in the normal range.

If your BMI is **more than 25**, talk to your doctor about ways to **control your weight!**



For additional information about BMI in general, please see **https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index** which was also the main source for the text and calculations used in this Shiny App.
